midnight karin johnson midnight alone man walked darkened street nothing hurt said heart picked beat wind blowing leaves around passed old dark house old broken gate front screeching like mouse saw light window believe eyes thought got prankster disguise heard stories old house thought lie help believe feet carry old man used live house whose ghost follows home light kills without second thought scream dark night saw candle moved started descending stairs started run faster faster pretending got house unlocked door looked back walked nothing except sound ever blowing wind shut door behind breathed heavy sigh could stupid dumb could almost cry turned go upstairs glanced mirror right behind reflection saw glow ghostly candlelight
