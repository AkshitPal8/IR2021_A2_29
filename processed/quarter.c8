singer depths steven myers dolphin pool crystal clear dr adams dropped keeyokee swam toward scientist following traditional greeting practice among dolphins rubbed nose get anywhere dave voice dolphin translation unit asked know kee others repaired equipment way back definitely something cant find well suppose rested long enough maybe help dolphin glided pool toward grey blue lit panel water line wall robotic arm dolphin back moved forward swiftfully touched panel responded opening reveal water filled passageway human dolphin alike swam tunnel followed turns arrived computer room submerged four feet water keeyokee immediately connected neural link implanted forehead left eye console aid artificial arm began review data research team collected two men two dolphins wearing elegantly light metalloglass pressure suits moved black water dolphins front leading two humans toward atlantis underwater research station well deserved rest built ridge near bottom pacific ocean atlantis station biggest successful deep sea laboratories unique joint operation run humans dolphins station produced oxygen power electrolysis purified sea water using hydrogen fuel fusion reactor pure oxygen atmosphere would extremely volatile explosive accident several years shown station kept oxygen problem circulating recirculation nitrogen throughout area keep ratio oxygen nitrogen earth surface unique crew compliment every general use deck atlantis research station flooded least one meter water equipment specifically designed environment terminals ports dolphin neural links party dolphins humans approached station odd creatures live depth attracted lights swam away intrusion notice taken siyoko highest ranking dolphin atlantis station opened outer airlock door term airlock though anachronism still used describe chamber used transfer point two incompatible environments four crew members inside lock great steel glass door slammed shut sea water drained dolphins danger suits aqueous environments pure water inside station rushed inner door opened humans able remove suits quickly two arms dolphins slower single arm aid artificial one managed however inner door unexpectedly slammed shut everyone went mad trapped halfway salvation death four mercy computer failure synthesized voice heard great door safety outer lock flushing commence five seconds four three two one commencing outer lock flush outer door opened almost smugly four creatures flung crushing grip bottom ocean alarm rang central processing room noise dr adams demanded frustration mounting something wrong airlock switch visiscreen airlock camera view large screen right wall flickered nothing kee noticed huh wonder computer screaming play back camera data last minutes dolphin saw fate crewmates suffered unfold eyes silence long time finally david broke could gone wrong kee dolphin answer david turned back toward lone companion place thousands miles nearest humans keeyokee still almost stiff seemed oblivious real world kee sort system failure david murdered murdered could murdered unless listen sound system came song hauntingly beautiful yet unbelievably dreadful power carried song evoked images terror mind david adams note echoed length time note echo varied throughout music david thought would go mad song ended released grip upon mind think understand said know dolphin navigates water dave sure echolocation natural sonar music played mapped ultrasonic range normal hearing range echolocation uses original range music playing airlock opened forms image mind using instincts look screen visiscreen showed creature like never seen man ways similar dolphin though much larger giving impression anger spikes bone jutted creature back place dolphin natural smile bore sneer accentuated dagger like teeth could easily seen dave seraphis david still understand seraphis ancient dolphin god furthest depths powerful gods gods tell would even consider explanation would evidence believe wish much scientist even think thing hear see found mt olympus next zeus would discount like well entirely different situation different mythology gods dolphin human somehow better well sorry going wait really care might well know killer whales worship seraphis day orcas get hungry disconnecting neural link keeyokee swam room without another word gone proficient art getting dolphin suit soon swimming way dark water toward something understand david waited decide keeyokee struck nerve dave thought immune prejudice plagued many people unfairly judged friend ideas even admitting prepared accept idea dolphin god attacking atlantis station living creature laboratory sat chair simply thought happened siren blazed second followed seconds later two synthesized voices fought heard din oxygen level rising critical level reached fifteen minutes magnetic field weakening hydrogen escape reactor fifteen minutes computer david screamed leaping chair emergency shut reactor unable perform requested action override clearance alpha gamma psi shut reactor unable perform requested action computer repeated music keeyokee played earlier began rush speakers throughout room shut music scientist commanded music currently played system got get whole place gone mad dove water made tunnel anything else could go wrong panel shut behind dave navigated water filled passageway submarine dock vehicle docked large impressive however used shipment large amounts equipment long distance travel offered less speed propelled pressure suits favored crew keeyokee approached cave atlantis equipment studying unlike many dolphins keeyokee still preferred instinctive echolocation sense visual orientation encouraged humans darkness held terror could hear knew going dolphin heard song seraphis progressed cave tempo increased mind keeyokee saw ancient deity moving closer god loomed dwarfing seraphis immense even atlantis station would seemed insignificant next name child god asked softly keeyokee dolphin answered angered keeyokee dolphin children become perverted look encased form shell appendages added meaning keeyokee need things humans work us necessary humans wish refashion form like us us like seraphis worshipped orcas become like wish way lost dolphins mine worship choose chosen dolphins need longer humans done shall face wrath wrath sea already place destroyed atlantis station dave pervert longer stop seraphis stop god shall treat respect god keeyokee spun around raced away presence god deity named seraphis screamed fearful agony form wavered disappeared dave smashed control panel door leading docking bay metal rod circuitry crackled door opened inch oxygen level critical ten minutes hydrogen escape fusion reactor ten minutes dave pushed rod crack using lever pushed strength door groaned moved albeit reluctantly squeezing opening dave entered bay seconds door slammed shut ran toward single submarine bay entered ignoring standard safety precautions fusion drive started smoothly took ship dock dave attempted open outer lock response calculated almost six minutes left knew fool around door drive powered ship began vibrate one giant burst submarine hurtled forward smashed lock tore ocean water away station dave headed east toward cave keeyokee gone station exploded five minutes later tossing ship end end hydrogen required one spark atlantis utterly destroyed keeyokee spotted submarine headed relief neither suffered harm minutes explosion keeyokee safely aboard submarine headed surface find kee dave asked nothing dolphin answered real gods thoughts added least anymore 
