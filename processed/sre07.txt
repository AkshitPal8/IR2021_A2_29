\ \ \ p e r \ introduction would thought sre7 must say impressed recieved fan mail requests ever files keep getting downloaded like crazy noone thank readers continue interested stories sre7 final chapter series rumored tell conclusion story \ prologue kazik regime dominant force multiverse millenia watched countless universes grow proceeded squash universe different kazik monitored grew respective galaxies even knowing galaxies existed always warring species aliens reason wars fought always brought best good always found way around oppression universes become captive evil forces kazik came overtook universe kazik feeling universe would harder conquer definately boring \ 1 sir sir yelled lieutenant bur krael whirled face chief scanner bur asked bur wanted look scanner held mind captive sir think found habited universe yelled bur krael breath drew short director petros station part petros extrauniversal exploration program organization desgined seek new universes might turn first ever discovered sure habited new universe asked krael excitedly bur nodded fast head looked like might fall got faint pictures new species got show amoko exclaimed bur pictures sent immediately faxcom amoko immediately switched vidterm view aliens appearance surprisingly similiar species one thing stuck mind though looked suffering starvation amoko hailed krael vidcom amoko get pictures asked amoko com yeah amazing simply amazing want look something however seem famished little investigating replied amoko krael nodded image vanished amoko sighed hopefully first extrauniversal contact would occur soon \ 2 hopni leader recon fleet mission simple go take detailed pictures come back throttled back hurtled subspace jump field quickly inside new universe within minutes would approaching group planets fleet dispersed spread seperate planet jobs results appeared universe verge collapsing starvation poverty krael knew something done hailed amoko vidcom amoko got pictures would seem people new universe bad shape got help said amoko thought moment get together goodwill fleet consisting 2 000 heavy cruisers get command ship ready ambassadors xenoscientists let scientists decide best let carry takes order amoko krael nodded shut vidcom \ 3 fleet outsiders entered kazik space kazik regime decided ploy worked order give enemy taste decided activate plazfield soon ships would gone admiral petyr stationed inside command ship nothing sir satellites ships nothing would seem even developed space travel yet said voice science officer jolma petyr knew must done consult scientists jolma voice interrupted sir reading incredible plasma wave scanner yelled vidscreen lit reveal wave consisting myriad colors hurtling toward activate deflector grids screamed advise cruisers send fleet wide alert ordered grids went match plazfield slammed fleet ships began dissolving petyr could feel cells screaming became ionized assimiliated wave scream vanished completely fleet ships completely destroyed except one small fighter seeing whole fleet destroyed immediately turned heel fled subspace jump field fighter survived pilot guke says massive wave plasma completely dissolved entire fleet said krael damn damn natural asked amoko krael shook head know much time analyze guke fighter detailed scanners like hc said put armada battle alert notify every empire situation advise put militaries battle alert may natural storm well let us get caught pants said amoko \ 4 small light kazik fighter screamed though space 700 times speed light pilot stopped craft exited subspace reached destination inside tau galaxy called allowed craft become visible permitting enemy scanners detect within minutes several defensive heavy cruisers heading towards waited longer still ignoring repeated attempts communicate enemy patrols came towards soon enough approximately five thousand heavy cruisers trying figure make unusual alien vessel time decided depressed appropriate control invisibility screen went back sir lost track simply vanished reported young woman stationed scanner let give little time ordered admiral naras maybe still trying understand messages nothing could disapear must scanner malfunction kind fools kazik pilot activated plazsphere brilliant violet colored sphere resonated ship expanding time enemy patrols figured sphere hurtling ashes kazik pilot chuckled mission accomplished left enemy universe \ 5 amoko believe someone eliminated 5 000 hcs attack carried stealth cunning deliberate planned somebody toying amoko knew deliberate put armada full defensive posture prepare possible invasion ordered stop something like happening get science team work vedet charge finding way disable plasma fields used people field operation simple wave ionized particles would sweep space ionizing type matter would come path thus converting plasma could think nothing could stop field every particle field every substance science susceptible ionization could think one possibility finding way get weapon penetrate field beam pure energy ionized since matter problem energy hardle properly channel transferred controlled special carrier waves used concentrate beam one pure energy weapon existed mounted amoko cyberian platform defensive weapon money needed build emitters exist energy weapons simply expensive would look possibilites \ 6 tecouk reviewed audlog eighth time thing admiral naras reported small ship responding hails requested massive assistance armada contacts naras gave clues spacecraft origin mission even appearance alien vessel underground dissident tecouk sure sketchy evidence team workers sweeping area attack type clues unlikely find anything mean solution heat soliton emitter mounted platform asked amoko vedet nodded nothing consisting oridinary matter hope pass field energy could even chance go unfortunately heat soliton beam energy beam capable passing field acting weapon vedet explained explanations clue ship came amoko inquired vedet shook head connection find plasma wave encountered new universe theorists believe possible someone used events encounter basis weapon noone sure point reported vedet amoko looked dissappointed keep work let know immediately find something amoko said reached shut vidcom getting frustrating \ 7 inspector tecouk got something stated hoj tecouk immediately looked really found replied hoj tilted head found residual ions left enemy weapon began tecouk interrupted nothing new hoj said let finish inspector replied tecouk nodded ions actually normal ions appear ions scanner examination one discovers really matter depolarized crystalline form said possible convert particles back normal matter done ions found turned pergium steel molecules come conclusion fighters built pergium steel specially designed decrystallizing repolarizing fields could pass plasma fields concluded tecouk paused overwhelming let guess already taken liberty constructing fighter asked hoj smiled know well inspector replied \ 8 tecouk taken findings amoko inside platform discovered certain substances like pergium steel ionized field depolarized crystallized added equipment needed make fighter pergium steel make impervious plasma weapons reported amoko stunned told plasma field ionized anything everything said never actually encountered field long enough scan analyze residual traces left fields ionized pergium steel molecules appeared ionized closer examintion discovered really tecouk explained amoko nodded good work luck finding anything tie together recent events asked unfortunately found one reference past history resembles plasma wave encountered new universe recorded sei galaxy ultra attempts overthrow vafan puttana nothing correlate either plasma wave alien fighter plasma weapons working assumption spacecraft underground faction overlooked somehow replied tecouk amoko turned chair desperate answers none good work far make sure ready type thing happens ordered nota premier kazik pilot charge invasion fleet eight hexagonal kazik fighting spacecraft blakta class fighters headed universe equivalent capitol amoko base cyberian platform target amoko supposedly charge 50 year old cyberian group made sure kept dissidents wraps destruction base would tkae universe surprise make easy kazik overcome nota told fellow pilots thatthey going take subspace thrustjump pulled back throttle opened craft subspace doorway graviton engines kicked ship screamed subspace amoko admiral rytek vidcom alert status reported grosene communications chief amoko activated vidcom rytek disheveled face filled screen amoko got eight enemy fighters headed way unless miss guess thing attacked naras fleet said amoko stared headed platform divert armada back home immediately prepare defenses said rytek nodded vidscreen sent blank grosene get vedet com fast emitter ready soon inspector tecouk also sending four fighters equipped technology believes counter plasma fields right every possible defense experimental expecting invasion soon said vedet amoko nodded understand important coming ready prepared whatever think work quickly ordered \ 9 nota fighters exited subspace quickly could need use invisibility screens undoubtedly enemy already detected entry heading expect fierce battle unfortunately enemy nota plazsphere weapons admiral enemies arrived evidence energy fields shielding deflector grids orders asked krael taking scanners rytek turned holog hail said simply puny aliens requesting communications nota decided would good talk enemy killed activated communications console attempted match enemy comm protocol nota lead pilot blakta force three wish say spoke face enemy rytek looked nota similiar appearance differences nota two arms one nota greetings lead pilot nota admiral rytek cyberian armada dissident group affiliated replied rytek nota looked confused know dissidents outsiders replied rytek glanced holog recording asked holog nodded nota afraid must ask withdraw space intruding upon space owned protected cyberian armada rytek said nota made gesture single hand care said nota vidscreen went dark \ 10 tecouk signaled rytek cavalry able handle enemy plasma fields know weapons said without warning enemy fighters ignited plazspheres fighters two three four activate polarcrystal grids ordered grids erected around fighters took red hue tecouk waited waited finally moment truth came plazsphere hit three grids scene taking place vidscreen frightening plazsphere polarcrystal grids ovbiously match finally every fighter lost power circumstances would failure grids held warded plazspheres open fire everything got ordered rytek notify platform use heat soliton emitter discretion said nota taken completely surprise enemy found way counter plazsphere impossible signaled fellow fighters activated shielding heat solition emitter warmed turbines churned many solition particles could tip emitter created superheated temperatures beam finally sprang connected one eight enemy fighters immediately exploded nota scared never history kazik regime culture able destroy plazsphere penetrate signaled six remaining pilots one activate plazsphere violet spheres careened grids surrounding fighters tecouk instruments went smoke activated audcom told three pilots let know commission one hit plazsphere would destroyed \ 11 nota fellow pilots almost power nota gave order expend power could destroy enemy forces nota would return kazik space notify regime mission failure something would done activated invisiblity screen initiated subspace thrustjump time battle kazik lost seven fighters cyberian armada lost two hcs worst casualities four prototype fighters lost fortunately vedet still knew technology \ 12 one kazik pilot still alive captured amoko learned everything kazik proceeded tell lead pilots important people names armada base organization called cyberian named amoko inquired kazik amoko sighed fifty years ago underground war man named cyber grew discontent handling situation unfortunately seized power almost kept universe freed overthrown eventually killed test detonation hydroxyl missile named organization purposes interests keeping universe safe agree methods achieving goal named everything died bravely explained tell people insist takingover cultures asked amoko kazik froze race multiverse defeat us always wait universe developed point provide us challenge battle proceed take said amoko looked people let kazik regime developed technology counter plasma weapons able defeat us stated kazik glared yes invisibility screens plus plethora weapons could use cyberian armada even fourth large kazik fleet people survive said coldly \ 13 krael returned petros station battle see repairs coming pleasure found complete discovered already preparing send another aid mission new universe circumstances making everything jumble kazik pilot captured rytek questioned much discovered kazik amoko find anything connect two plasma encounters concluded plasma wave new universe natural nota reported everything regime proceeded assemble two hundred fighter fleet nota command invade enemy universe destroy cyberian platform new fighters equipped three different beam arrays modified plasma weapons invisibility screens matter much defense enemy time would destroyed \ 14 amoko sitting quietly living chamber watching latest vidseries three alert sounded heck alert answer amoko silent question rumble spread chamber walls started splitting explosions ruptured floor smoke billowing everything amoko choking platform must attack get command center get soon notify admiral rytek attack tell enemy invisible need assistance need ordered commander jol jol charge platform defenses amoko arriving take command meanwhile prepare heat solition emitter try find anything detect damned enemy ships yelled news spread quickly without able see enemy cyberian platform destroyed amoko died platform well entire cyberian armada intact base return krael quickly taken action notified every admiral armada coud transfer flags petros station thing would qualify base vedet working building new heat solition emitter limited funds also constructing several portable units installed three remaining command ships armada every empire notified full battle alert krael needed money construct emitters equip every armada ship polarcrystal grid krael expected battle expected alright kazik shown ruthless krael prepared fight even people going lose
