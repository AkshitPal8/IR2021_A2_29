petros station buzzing activity destruction cyberian platform death amoko caused short hysteria krael worked quickly taking initiative told four admirals cyberian armada would welcome petros station could transfer flags admiral armada refused offer fact named krael amoko successor director cyberian group krael set building new fighters heavy cruisers armada equipped pergium steel frames polarcrystal shielding proved effective kazik plasma weapons also ordered equipped powerful energy units would better chance survival krael knew needed erect similiar shielding devices station also four command ships armada funds required build items available krael asked every empire galaxy send donations even given shielding company called target shielding agreed shield three hundred thousand fighters armada krael knew measures would give fighting chance survival sure enough one chapter 2 admiral rytek made commander chief krael request told krael feel enough experience command armada asked rytek perform tasks rytek taken reins alot work deploying fighters heavy cruisers strategic places knew little kazik military position kazik could become invisible fact alone allowed strike anywhere wished also alot work reorganizing fleet completely refurbished krael managed get funds build five heat soliton emitters four mounted command ships mounted petros station idea krael scrounged get money expensive endeavors rytek personally suspected krael shut petros extrauniversal exploration program compensate new massive military spending rytek work cut wildcat empirial representative cyberian group organization charge eliminating underground dissident forces arrival kazik cyberian group changed focus battle kazik forces wildcat charge letting krael know position empires included united empire association accounted 95 empires five percent secluded preferred anything massive cyberian group wildcat empire based sree galaxy brief stints galaxy deceti kazik posed serious threats across board noone knew exactly going except wanted conquer universe wildcat unsure whether kazik aware empirial system roots main structure empirial system first instituted sree evenutally every galaxy utilized amoko dissolved empirial system sree formed massive universal force battle underground many thought one person power dangerous fact dissolved centuries old system empires emperors empresses kazik posing new threats empires right sovereignity chapter 3 inspector tecouk put charge searching remains cyberian platform completed search turned interesting items residual effects left attack gave new insight weapons kazik possessed besides plazspheres would investigations lab analyze findings pretty sure would find hoj tecouk trusted aid gone information meticulously believed correct kazik seemed used phase induced gluon beams technology required create continuous gluon beam incredible gluons physically deattached subatomic particles bound together ovbiously kazik found way actually used phase inducer gluon particles incredibly powerful could easily stopped plasma sphere also meant another class ship attacked platform would turn findings vedet processing chapter 4 ecstatic new leader tau galaxy ecstatic long heralded emperor history unpredictability led vast fortune unconventionalism always worked advantage however ecstatic called upon strangest place wildcat representative uea cyberian group need assitant wanted ecstatic ecstatic knew wildcat history emperor feline realm sree time mace reappearance also present underground wars small empire wildcat propsered fifty years since ecstatic would happy help someone like wildcat indication kazik coming back asked krael rytek shook head made moves even indicated next move battle imminenece alert shifts occuring allowance refurbishing armada replied krael leaned back leatherback chair looked admiral regala admiral want position fighter divisions along outskirts universe near border new universe ordered meanwhile giving admiral rytek field promotion full admiral six stars krael continued rytek looked surprise promoted commander chief armada sure unexpected admiral dwool divs need brought back home protecting petros station admiral celmn heavy cruisers split assisting admirals regala dwool krael said four admirals nodded compliance giving control plasma one two three four divisions full commodore noliana well black thunder heavy cruiser division equipped vedet new subspace thrustjump engines jumping border station krael said noliana thanked krael sir asked yes thank full commodore replied krael noliana nodded left krael looked began gentlemen something else need discuss chapter 5 kazik going move quickly blakta force seven elite powerful military division kazik armed forces sent expressed purpose destroying petros station wiping defense fleet blakta force seven elite consisted three thousand blakta ships along one portable command powernode weaklings universe survive loka informed leadership role named commander blakta seven invasion invisiblity shields force would move unsuspecting station small numbers vastly superior fire power could easily wipe station successfully engage cyberian armada blakta seven ships equipped dynafuel storage containers would allow remain invisible fire weapons move time advantage hope enemy chapter 6 full commodore noliana command ship control small fleet four admirals recieved luxuries noliana make mightily armored heavy cruiser contemplating things battle imminence alert went tapped audcom bed command central noliana going queried brief attack admiral regala frontier came reply engage subspace jump field prepare make thrustjump ordered upon arrival found reported brief attack occurred incapacitating five fighters

regala battle alert petros defense outposts two six ten twenty four fifty picked brief traces talvite particles strange occurances deduced particles must residuals incoming attackers chapter 7 damn talvite particles know means screamed tecouk hoj shook head mean sir asked plasma particles gluon traces pergium nitrate specks pergium lithium sheets put two two together hoj replied hoj see inspector getting see engines leaving talvite particles ovbiously using thrustjump engines using plasma gluon weapons type power power weapons type maneuver remain invisible requires several different types conversions impossible invert redistribute least five different types energies requried make several conclusions one ship size use convetional subspace generators must using power distributors even point pergium nitrate pergium lithium along believed generator residuals must something else weapons residuals suspect go polarcrystal defense grids switch less powerful effective pergium converter punch hole straight grids make vulnerable plasma spheres explained tecouk hoj realized tecouk making serious jumps logic complete idea far situation order armada use 50 polarcrystal grids 50 standard defensive grids sir said tecouk nodded hoj always knew wanted want us use 50 polarcrystal grids demanded admiral rytek hoj image least nodded inspector tecouk believes kazik pergium converters go right polarcrystal grids explained rytek sighed spending much money developing new defensive grids told might work alright make necessary changes said chapter 8 steco leader relief fleet krael given order send small envoy hcs back new universe armada readied petros extrauniversal exploration scientists directed planet felt needed relief worst steco men deploying planetpods planetpods

news gotten steco krael ordered steco visit least six planets different galaxies steco complied findings aliens alive robots absolutely nothing except giving illusion life krael ordered fleet home awaiting incoming kazik invaders detected petros defense stations blakta force seven elite made arrival petros scanned entire fleet front found nothing new equipped polarcrystal grids difference immediately activated plazspheres smoke filled command center command ship dwool coughed coughed thought going use plazspheres said chief scanner lasru swiveled face admiral sir scans complete two enemy ships invisible based amount blasts recieved attack imagine full number enemy ships thousands deeper scan reveals pergium converter weapons appears inspector tecouk wrong reported damn send fighters frontal div traveling top speed random courses attempting ram invisible vessels fighters hcs firing random locations going use emitter two visible ships carry orders said appropriate plasma storm divisions called kazik kazik using plasma weapons indeed look like plasma storm outside noliana rerouted back petros seemed like hope ramming operations ordered admiral dwool mildly successful taken one hundred invisible enemy ships two visible kazik ships destroyed well dwool ordered armada watch much energy expended fighter divisions rotating turns carriers recharging energy units hoping outlast enemy hcs carriers command ship could go forever without needing recharge primary defensive weapon fighters need outlast enemy loka blakta force seven elite heroically going dock twenty blaktas petros station overrun inside regime ordered destroy station overtake get complete surrender armada would carry instructions chapter 10 celmn hcs fighters brought back together coming back reinforce dwool full admiral rytek fleet brought back well full commodore noliana already diverted ultrafast fleet back petros plunging battle switched back 100 polarcrystal grids learning enemy using weapon besides plazsphere mistake using 50 cost dwool fleet dearly arrival reinforcements change krael engrossed battle technically chance kazik learned several kazik ships made visible hard docked station ovbiously intended overtake krael decided one thing military would destroyed going keep celmn small fleet hand noliana rytek dwool going go universal front assist regala kazik going take station destroy reason leave forces slaughtered defense steco crew made complete survey 1000 planets span fifteen galaxies universe findings always none planets type biological life even intelligent life seeded robots even holograms living beings none real steco beginning believe entire universe faked knows reason two galaxies left sampled even though left fifty thousand planets unchecked would take years time waste chapter 11 loka lead pilot blakta force seven elite surrender petros station kazik regime destroyed superior forces said krael gazed intently second kazik ever met petros station surrenders effective immediately kazik regime replied smile even flinch cyberian armada also surrender effective immediately ordered krael hesitated uh afraid answer one said loka eyes filled disgust surrender armada questions mere formality win screamed returned look fire damn hope surrender station armada command full admiral rytek controls armada want armada surrender talk responded slapped

head pressure head incredible brain felt like fire thoughts interrupted intense pain ever felt knew brain convulsing pulsing throbbing brain finally caught fire rest escape pod terrible death chapter 12 kazik unprepared psionic bomb entire series events carried krael away way detonation took less ten minutes completely surprised especially discovered invisible defensive grids protect psionic reaction died although painfully mesur recieved blast head command ship intact petros station intact carriers hcs intact unfortunately possible shield fighters crews petros defense outposts celmn thought ends justified deaths regime heard terrible failure entire blakta force seven elite destroyed minus twenty invaders inside petros station resourcefulness creatures universe beginning annoy decided would send every craft kazik armed forces petros knew entire cyberian armada rerouted universal front would questions outcome battle nothing would stop would install shields protect new weapons chapter 13 steco discovered something big team spotted gigantic base inside final galaxy visiting sent smallest craft could ovbiously made undetected discovered something even encouraging base contained real living beings kazik living beings knew must base audcommed rytek information armed forces departed kazik regime praetorial palace subspace thrustjumped enemy universe five hundred thousand various crafts blaktas koors aljoms small fighters heading towards petros station invisible admiral getting something inspector tecouk said communications monitor rytek simply nodded vidcom came full admiral time waste got look one alien spacecraft know becoming invisible fear going invaded sent schematics engineers secured com channel make modifications spare time making help us end invisibility done simple additions deflector grids means hard time modifying fighters hcs carriers command ships within hour tecouk said rytek said thank inspector got get someone going let go cut channel nodded chief engineer get ordered simply com monitor spoke full admiral rytek steco vidcom channel nodded rytek listen accidentally found kazik headquarters location coming code invade still know discovered location steco said short sweet oh well seemed eveything going fast let know modifications done invade kazik base ordered chapter 14 first volley plasmafire hit station constant battering recieved past weeks krael getting used grids notify rytek attack circumstances come help us ordered krael activate station invisiblity tell celmn activate fleet invisiblity continued around various officers busily complied requests okay tricky part activate station retrofields move us far normal position possible said lord prince become invisible reported short woman manning scanner prince kolmy pounded desk could possible screamed regime ovbiously would disappointed fire last known positions send koors projected ramming courses aim possible petros station locations prince ordered cyberian armada headed towards kazik headquarters blinding speed felt like invisibility grids made faster even though rytek knew ridiculous mysterious kazik base loomed ahead fire invisible asked sorry sir drained way much power journey came reply deactivate invisibility three command ships fire heat soliton emitters base ordered inside kazik regime praetorial palace praetor regime surprised feel chambers shaking tapped little green button wall going demanded praetor attack junior officer replied praetor jumped screamed screamed screamed possible heard throughout palace kazik unconquerable battlers invaded petros shaking station named unswerving stone name defiled battle even invisiblity buying protection location discovered energy required move new location available celmn fleet fair circumstances fighters required become visible keep using energy hcs going become visible soon well power supplies last much longer unfortunately armada reconstructed invisibility mind fight brave krael knew beaten odds reminded feqh deathsong die die well called would die well praetor kazik regime surrendered kazik regime praetorial palace cyberian armada admirals dwool regala advised destroy base rytek want completely destroy ordered damage severely leave part intact would leave regala fleet rest armada would head back petros see going neglected tell krael leaving going
